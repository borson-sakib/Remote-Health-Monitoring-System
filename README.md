# Remote-Health-Monitoring-System
Remote health monitoring is beneficial to patients in a way that the process or implementation will
save the hospital bills, waiting time as we do not have to go and wait in line before our time comes also it
reduces time complexity in the hospitals. The system is designed in such a way that a patient can be
monitored remotely in real time. To complete this project, we needed sensors which measures body
temperature, heart rate controlled by the microcontroller. Readings can be seen from a distant place or
from anywhere around the world. This will help the health professionals to observe critical patient on a
continuous basis and tracking their health issues. Many projects on this topic have been done throughout
the world which are quite complicated as well as expensive to implicate in real life. But we propose a
system which is financially feasible and easy to implement. This project is all about exploring Improved
services for patients. Monitoring patients properly is a vital part and hence remotely monitoring and
raising awareness in an authenticated manner is the purpose behind this Project. Hence, the main
objective of the proposed project was to collect data through Arduino microcontroller and transfers it to
the cloud where it is further processed and analyzed.
